## How to Run

Update the provided "procedures\_triggers\_functions\_views.sql" file with your database name (the same one you plan to use in dbcon.js).
Next, import the provided sql files "insert\_entity\_data.sql" and "procedures\_triggers\_functions\_views.sql" into your database.
These files should have been distributed to you independently, but you can also find them in the init/ folder.

Then, update dbcon.js.template with your credentials, and remove the ".template extension"

Run npm-install

Run node index.js [port]
